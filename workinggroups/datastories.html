<h1>Data Stories</h1>

<hr class="head" /> With the expansion of artificial intelligence and machine learning applications into every sphere of life, the search for quality data has also increased. From being the target for “untapped” data mining, to being a site for data collection and a contributor to the bulk of data labelling (ghost work) labour, the Continent plays a central role in the global data landscape. Yet, the continent’s relationship with the rest of the global academic and research landscape is often marked with unparalleled power asymmetries, deficit narratives, and complex and nuanced systematic historical exploitations. Data practices are barely critically examined, simplistic approaches that reduce the continent's complex challenges to data and AI permeate and furthermore, African stories are often narrated by non-Africans. Underpinned by nuances and critical approaches to data practices, the Data Economies working group envisions research that fundamentally centres Africa and Africans. <br>

	<h4>MD4SG Data Browser</h4>
	
<p> MD4SG dataset browser is a web application that has been developed to help users quickly find MD4SG related datasets. It allows users to browse through listed datasets, filter them by various criteria, and even provide capabilities for users to suggest new datasets. The data browser is for everyone who wants to:
</p>&nbsp;<br>
<p><ul>
	<li>learn more about different kinds of data,</li>
	<li> visualize data per location, and</li>
	<li> access data for research purposes.</li>
</ul>
</p>
	<h4> Data Collection/ Practices in Africa</h4>
<p>In the past, we have focused on data sharing throughout the African continent and examined the social, historical, structural, and infrastructural obstacles that posed a challenge to equitable data sharing practices. Our ongoing projects include exploring responsible AI in Africa, critical investigations into the data collection pipeline, as well as the underpaid and overexploited "market" of data labelling. </p><br>

<h3>Resources and Events</h3>
	<h4>CRAFT Session</h4>
	
<p> Our FAccT 2021 CRAFT session, "Narratives and Counternarratives on Data Practices in the Global South," is an interactive workshop that uses storytelling as a method to question common assumptions around data practices in countries and communities that are often grouped as "the Global South." Building on our current project around data sharing in Africa, — and our own autoethnographic observations in other countries — we will provide various theme-based stories that are informed by common narratives around data practices and invite participants to challenge these narratives from various angles including historical contexts and cultures, legal limitations, accessibility, impact assessments, accountability mechanism, and more. </p>
<br>
<p>Our post-conference plan is to create "Narratives and Counternarratives on Data Practices in the Global South" story cards. Our hope is that these cards then will be used by data science educators, civil society groups, philanthropic groups, inter-governmental organizations such as the UN agencies, and technology companies to expose them to narratives and counternarratives of data practices in the Global South and inform them about challenges before they embark on any new initiatives.</p>
