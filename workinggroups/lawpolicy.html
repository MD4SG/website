<h1>Algorithms, Law, and Policy</h1>

<hr class="head" />
<p>Algorithms are deployed &ldquo;in the wild&rdquo; in numerous sectors of public and private industry, including medicine, law, education, and employment. Many of these sectors are grappling with how laws and policies are shaped by, responding to, and leveraging this pervasive use of algorithms. The MD4SG Working Group on Algorithms, Law, and Policy focuses on this complex relationship between algorithms and mechanisms on the one hand and law and policy on the other hand. Some of the topics the group will work on include but are not limited to free speech, content moderation, antitrust, the use of &ldquo;black box&rdquo; machine learning models, data-driven algorithms, and decision-support tools. We study the real-world impacts of these methods through the lens of law and public policy. We also aim to support law and policy practitioners through, for instance, providing digital forensic expert assistance. This group is starting in Spring 2021 and grew out of the earlier <a href="fairness.html">Bias, Discrimination, and Fairness</a> working group.</p>
<p>
	We meet every other week for a presentation from an invited speaker or group member, followed by a group discussion. In addition to these meetings, we have two ongiong research projects.
</p>&nbsp;

<h2 dir="ltr"><b>Research Projects</b></h2>

	<h3>Policy & Free Speech</h3>


	<p>
		The World Wide Web has become a major mode of expression and upended the roles of the historical speech environment: Private technology platforms&mdash;especially social media&mdash;must moderate speech in a manner that respects individual freedom of speech. Governments must regulate private online-speech platforms to protect freedom of speech and promote competition.
This new speech environment creates new incentives and affordances for strategic behavior and manipulation: The technical moderation and surveillance capacities of private platforms present tempting targets for governments to coopt. The power of large private platforms rivals that of nation states and presents opportunities to influence the governments that provide a check to these private platforms. The search and recommendation algorithms of large private platforms effectively smother or amplify speech. And speech is now acutely weaponizable against individuals, protestors, and activists.
What are the implications of these incentives and affordances in the new speech environment? The Policy and Free Speech Project studies the mechanism design and algorithmic dimensions of these questions.
	</p>

	<h3>Risk Assessment Tools in Criminal Justice</h3>
	<p>
Risk assessment tools are used at various stages of the criminal justice system&mdash;including pre-trial services, setting bail, and sentencing. We are primarily interested in how stakeholders <i>use</i> and <i>view</i> these tools, and the impact these tools have on the criminal justice system at large. Research questions we are considering include: When to practitioners choose to follow or ignore the advice of an algorithmic tool? What type of transparency or interpretability is needed in order to use an algorithmic tool responsibly? How do stakeholders interpret the output of these tools, and does this reflect the tool's original intention?
