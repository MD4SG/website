<h1>Civic Participation</h1>
In most cases, addressing large-scale social problems requires changes in policy.
For this, democratic institutions are invaluable achievements since they offer paths for effecting positive social change and since theyprovide protections against changes that would harm subgroups in the population.
Still, prominent examples show that existing institutions often fail to be responsive to needed change or fail to protect minority rights.
Because of this, there is an urgent need to investigate changes and additions to democratic processes that could improve their performance.
Additionally, there is recent concern about the stability of democratic institutions across the world, and it preserving these institutions might require democratic reform.

The MD4SG working group on Civic Participation brings together researchers who are passionate about exploring ways to deepen democracies.
Crucially, our group connect mathematical views on these questions with perspectives from social science and practical experience.

<h3>Fall 2021 Syllabus</h3>
This Fall, our main interest is practice: We’ve been hearing about problems encountered on the ground that computer science and economics have perhaps abstracted away, and about ways in which ideas from these disciplines can contribute to discussions among practitioners and lead to eventual real-world impact.
Throughout the semester, we have invited three outside speakers with experience in driving democratic reform and innovation.
Each speaker joined the group for two sessions: In the first session, the speaker presented their work and afterwards discussed with the group. Over the following two weeks, a subset of the group reflected on the speaker’s presentation, read up on connected topics, and drew connections to existing work/possible opportunities for work in the mathematical fields. Two weeks after the original presentation, this subgroup presented their thoughts to the rest of the seminar and to the invited speaker, sparking a second round of discussions.
