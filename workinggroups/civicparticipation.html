<h1>Civic Participation</h1>
For better or worse, government policy impacts most large-scale social problems. Because of this, the decision-making processes inside our democratic institutions are crucial: good processes offer paths for effecting positive social change, whereas bad processes may encourage changes that harm parts of the population. Many recent examples show that existing institutions fail to be responsive to needed change or fail to protect minority rights. Because of this, there is an urgent need to investigate modifications and additions to democratic processes that could improve their performance. Additionally, there is recent concern about the stability of democratic institutions worldwide, and preserving these institutions might require democratic reform. The MD4SG working group on Civic Participation brings together researchers who are passionate about exploring ways to deepen democracies. Crucially, our group connects mathematical views on these questions with perspectives from social science and practical experience.

<h3>2022/2023 Syllabus</h3>
This Fall, we want to support group members in starting new research collaborations. Below is our tentative schedule:
<table class="rg" style="width:100%"><tbody>
    <tr class="module"><td>Week 1: Kick-off</td><td>
After a brief introduction of the group’s mission, we will hear lightning talks from each group member (2 min - 1 slide.)
    </tr><tr><td>Week 2: Speaker #1</td><td>
Come and listen to an expert’s perspective on civic participation.
</tr><tr><td>Week 3: Speaker Response #1</td><td>
Part of our group presents ideas for follow-up research based on the previous talk, and we continue the discussion with the speaker.
</tr><tr><td>Week 4: Democracy Hackathon</td><td>
Suggest a project pitch (a question that might lead to research, a topic to write about, ….). We’ll group around these pitches and race to make some tangible progress on the pitch. Maybe this can
 start a new project.
</tr><tr><td>Week 5: Speaker #2</td><td>
Come and listen to an expert’s perspective on civic participation.
</tr><tr><td>Week 6: Speaker Response #2</td><td>
Part of our group presents ideas for follow-up research based on the previous talk, and we continue the discussion with the speaker.
</tr><tr><td>Week 7: Semester Wrap-Up</td><td>
We celebrate the semester’s ending, plan next steps, and showcase things created by group members over the semester.

<h3>2021/2022 Syllabus</h3>
Over the past academic year, our main interest was practice: We've been hearing about problems encountered on the ground that computer science and economics have perhaps abstracted away, and about ways in which ideas from these disciplines can contribute to discussions among practitioners and lead to eventual real-world impact.
For this purpose, we have invited six outside speakers with experience in driving democratic reform and innovation.
Each speaker joined the group for two sessions: In the first session, the speaker presented their work and discussed it with the group. Over the following two weeks, a subset of the group reflected on the speaker's presentation, read up on connected topics, and drew connections to existing work/possible opportunities for work in the mathematical fields. Then, in the second session, this subgroup presented their thoughts to the rest of the seminar and to the invited speaker, sparking a second round of discussions.
