<h1>REDNACECYT-MD4SG 2023 Summer of Science Program</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<div
	The goal of the Summer of Science Program is to support female students from indigenous communities in Mexico as they design and execute research projects aimed at improving their local communities. Applicants to the program are students at various levels of postgraduate education, and they prepare proposals aimed at using STEM methodologies to address relevant issues in their communities. Students who are accepted to the program are paired with mentors from MD4SG to work through their projects over the Summer. The end deliverable of this collaboration between mentors and students is a poster presentation which the students give at the Association of Computing Machinery (<a href="https://www.acm.org/" target="_blank">ACM</a>) Conference on Equity and Access in Algorithms, Mechanisms, and Optimization (<a href="https://eaamo.org/" target="_blank">EAAMO</a>).
</div>
<div>
	The previous iteration of the program, the <a href="https://eaamo.org/copocyt/" target="_blank">"COPOCYT-MD4SG Summer of Science"</a> accepted 8 female indigenous students from the Huasteca region of San Luis Potos&#xed;, Mexico to present posters at EAAMO '22 which took place at George Mason University  in the United States. The students  were from T&#xe9;nek and Nahuatl-speaking  communities   and their projects  spanned  the broad  themes of:  preservation of indigenous language/culture,  affordable housing, and equitable access to healthcare for indigenous communities. 
</div>
<br>
<div>
	This year's Summer of Science Program is a partnership between the Mechanism Design for Social Good (MD4SG) research initiative and the National Network of Councils and State Organizations of Science and Technology (<a href="https://www.rednacecyt.org/" target="_blank">REDNACECYT</a>). 
</div>
<br>
<div>
	We are thrilled to announce that <b>this year we have accepted 21 female students overall from the states of Michoac&#225;n, Sinaloa, Chihuahua, Estado de M&#xe9;xico, Veracruz, Puebla y San Luis Potos&#xed;. The students are members of 11 indigenous communities overall (Cuanajo, Pur&#xe9;pecha, Mixteco, Tepehuan, Rar&#xe1;muri, Mazahua, Zapoteca, N&#xe1;huatl, T&#xe9;nek, Mazateca and Zoque)</b>. The projects proposed by these students cover a wide array of topics, including (amongst others): understanding and improving collective decision-making in indigenous communities, preserving indigenous culture and identity, providing equitable healthcare and housing, and understanding perceptions of environmental policy in local indigenous communities.
