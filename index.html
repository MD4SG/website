					Mechanism Design for Social Good (MD4SG) is a multi-institutional initiative using techniques from algorithms, optimization, and mechanism design, along with insights from other disciplines, to improve access to
					opportunity for historically underserved and disadvantaged communities. Members of MD4SG include researchers from computer science, economics, operations research, public policy, sociology, humanistic studies, and other
					disciplines as well as domain experts working in non-profit organizations, municipalities, and companies.

				<p>
					We take an interdisciplinary approach to improve equity and social welfare for marginalized groups. We have worked in problems across a variety of domains such as education, development, fairness and discrimination,
					housing, healthcare, inequality, and labor markets. Our goal is to facilitate interactions across academia, policy, and industry and to foster collaborations across disciplines. To this end, we organize a monthly online
					colloquium series, domain-specific working groups, workshops and tutorials, and other activities aimed at exploring new research directions, implementing and deploying solutions, and highlighting exemplary work.
