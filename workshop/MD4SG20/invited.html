<h2>Stephanie Dinkins, Artist Fellow at the Berggruen Institute</h2>

<hr class="projectTitle" />
<p class="abstract">Bio: <a href="https://www.stephaniedinkins.com/" target="_blank">Stephanie Dinkins</a> is a transmedia artist who creates platforms for dialog about artificial intelligence (AI) as it intersects race, gender, aging, and our future histories. She is particularly driven to work with communities of color to co-create more inclusive, fair and ethical artificial intelligent ecosystems. Dinkins&rsquo; art practice employs lens-based practices, emerging technologies and community engagement to confront questions of bias in AI, consciousness, data sovereignty and social equity. Investigations into the contradictory histories, traditions, knowledge bases and philosophies that form/in-form society at large underpin her thought and art production. Dinkins earned an MFA from the Maryland Institute College of Art in 1997 and is an alumna of the Whitney Independent Studies Program. She exhibits and publicly advocates for inclusive AI internationally at a broad spectrum of community, private and institutional venues &ndash; by design. Dinkins is a 2019 Creative Capital Grantee as well as a 2018/19 Soros Equality Fellow, Data and Society Research Institute Fellow and 2018 Sundance New Frontiers Story Lab Fellow.</p>

</center>
Community, Craft, and the Vernacular in Artificial Intelligence takes the position that everyone participating in society is an expert in our experiences within the community infrastructures which inform the makeup of artificially intelligent systems. Although we may not be intellectually aware of jargon used in exclusionary contexts, we share the vernacular of who we are as people and a community and the intimate sense that our data is being used by big entities. Afro-now-ism asks us to ground our understanding by taking the imaginary leap of defining ourselves and our communities outside of systemic oppression in order to craft the systems we'd like to see. Stephanie Dinkins uses her practice as an artist. Stephanie Dinkins will use her practice as an artist working with AI to illustrate these ideas.

</center>
Caregiving in the home, outside of traditional clinical settings, is a societally-important, yet under-addressed, application domain that is ripe for digital innovation. I will introduce the context of caregiving, example technical opportunities (e.g., precision sensing, mixed reality,  conversational agents), and ecosystem challenges (e.g., misaligned incentives in healthcare, commercialization, and research). I will emphasize the centrality of values in design to the framing of technical problems and solutions (e.g., equity, quality of life and work, dignity, privacy) and the need to intentionally make room for innovation framed in terms of  Public Interest needs.

    font-weight: bold;">Maximizing the Social Good: Markets without Money</h3>
</center>
To create a truly sustainable world, we need to generate ample resources and allocate them appropriately.  In traditional economics, these goals are achieved using money.  However, in many settings of particular social significance, monetary transactions are infeasible, be it due to ethical considerations or technological constraints.   In this talk, we will discuss alternatives to money and show how to use them to achieve socially-optimal outcomes. In this talk, we will discuss alternatives to money, including information asymmetry and risk, and show how to use them to achieve socially-optimal outcomes.  Information asymmetry enables an informed group to influence a decision maker.  This can benefit groups with the power to leverage influence.  Using this insight, we study the disparate impact of unequal access to influence.  Risk helps determine a person's value for a resource: the more someone is willing to risk for something, the more they value it.  Using this insight, we propose an algorithm to find a good assignment of students in school choice programs

</center>
Anjana Rajan is the chief technology officer of Polaris, an NGO based in Washington DC that fights human trafficking and modern slavery. Her expertise is applying cryptography to national security and human rights issues. Earlier this year, Anjana was a tech policy fellow at the Aspen Institute, where she focused on answering a central question: how can we create privacy-preserving ways to prevent mass gun violence caused by white supremacist extremists? This problem is challenging because it touches upon many different complex issues: counterterrorism, gun control policy, domestic violence, privacy & civil liberties, and cryptography. In this talk, Anjana will discuss her solution of confidential digital reporting escrows for witnesses to safely report while ensuring the civil liberties of both the witness and suspect are protected. Her talk will elaborate on the cryptographic design of this solution and will underscore the important intersection of technical expertise, research expertise, and policy expertise.
