      <p> This <a href="https://ec20.sigecom.org/program/workshops-tutorials/">tutorial</a> will bring to bear tools from economics and computer science on a core problem of social good: provision of goods to vulnerable populations. By definition, forms of vulnerability such as poverty preclude access to goods through normal market channels. Without intervention, this can be ruinous individually and greatly suboptimal socially. Universal provision is one often-touted solution, but can be costly and inefficient. Consequently, more targeted approaches are common, but must contend with lack of priors about the population of interest. We survey the rich mechanism design and machine learning questions inherent in the most prevalent approaches to this unique resource allocation problem and suggest directions for future work from the EC community. </p><br/>

     <h3>Target Audience</h3>

 
    <p>The tutorial will be self-contained, and designed for students and researchers in computer science and economics without assuming previous knowledge of public / social service provision. It will emphasize applications of tools from machine learning and mechanism design in promoting social good. The audience will be exposed to potentially new models from economics and theoretical computer science which capture key issues in provision. The discussion of empirical work will illustrate the complexities of practical implementation, highlight the importance of experimentation to understanding relevant factors for vulnerable populations in particular, and suggest potential for further theoretical work. </p> 
    
       <h3>Schedule</h3>
    Pre-recording will take place over the course of two days.
    <ul>
    <li>Session 1: Thursday June 25, 11-11:45am and 12-12:45pm Eastern</li>
    <li>Exercise Session: Thursday June 25, 3-4pm Eastern </li>
     <li>Session 2: Friday June 26, 11-11:45am and 12-12:45pm Eastern</li>
    </ul>
EC tutorial watch parties will take place on July 13.</p>
    
    <h3>Registration</h3>
