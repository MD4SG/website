        We are very pleased to provide funds to subsidize the costs of registration, travel, and accommodation for student presenters, and for MD4SG workshop participants who do not typically attend the EC conference, including non-academic participants. Travel grants are limited and will be made available based on participant need and relevance to workshop. <br/><br/>

To apply, please email <a href="mailto:organizers@md4sg.com">organizers@md4sg.com</a> with the subject line "Travel Support" by <strong>April 24</strong>, and address the following points: 

<ul>
<li>First and last name</li>
<li>Department and University / Organization</li>
<li>Advisor's name (if applicable)</li>
<li>Are you from an organization or department that is not typically represented at EC?</li>
<li>What is the expected estimate of support needed for travel, registration, and accommodation?</li>
<li>Identification of any underrepresented groups, if applicable. (We encourage applications from members of underrepresented groups.)</li>
<li>Do you have access to other funds which would allow you to attend the workshop?</li>
<li>Describe in a sentence or two how you will benefit from attending the workshop.</li>
</ul>

You will be notified about your status by May 13, which is prior to the EC early registration deadline. <br/><br/>
