In 2005, based on work in his PhD thesis, Boston's school committee adopted a new mechanism for student placement, citing the desire to make it easier for participants to navigate and to level the playing field for the city's families. He has also helped to design the Chicago, Denver, Newark, New Orleans, New York, and Washington DC school choice systems. In 2013, he was appointed as Mayor Thomas Menino's chief technical advisor for Boston's student assignment plan.

    <p class="abstract"><a href="http://scholar.harvard.edu/mshepard/" target="_blank">Mark Shepard</a> is an assistant professor at Harvard Kennedy School of Government. His main research studies health economics, with a focus on insurance competition and industrial organization issues. His research has studied how adverse selection affects insurers' incentives to cover top academic hospitals in exchanges like those established by the Affordable Care Act. He also has work studying subsidy design and competition in health insurance exchanges and claiming behavior in Social Security. Mark received his PhD in economics from Harvard University in 2015 and was a Post-doctoral Fellow in Aging and Health Economics at the National Bureau of Economic Research in the 2015-16 academic year. Before graduate school, he received an A.B. in applied math from Harvard College (2008) and spent a year working at the Brookings Institution's Engelberg Center for Health Care Reform.

        <h2>Glen Weyl, Microsoft Research New England</h2><hr class="projectTitle" />
    <p class="abstract"><a href="http://glenweyl.com/" target="_blank">E. (Eric) Glen Weyl</a>  is a Senior Researcher at Microsoft Research New England. He is visiting Yale University as a Visiting Senior Research Scholar and Lecturer in the economics department and law school, where he teaches a joint economics-computer science course, "Designing the Digital Economy". Glen's research aims to draw on tools from adjacent disciplines, such as law, computer science and philosophy, to develop practical proposals to expand the scope of efficient markets. For example, Glen developed a market mechanism for group decision-making, Quadratic Voting (QV), and has proposed a replacement for private property that combats its tendency to create monopoly power. He is drawing these themes together with his most common collaborator, University of Chicago law professor Eric Posner, into a book, Radical Markets, that offers a comprehensive package of policy ideas to respond to the current crisis of the liberal order and is under contract with the Princeton University Press. He also is co-founder of, Eric and Kevin Slavin of Collective Decision Engines, a start-up that commercializes QV for market research applications.
