</h3>
		</center>
		We study the effects of a reform that increased the stakes of the national exam at the end of high school for university enrolment in Spain. We find a negative effect of the reform on female test scores, driven by a worse performance in the exams for which the stakes increase the most, and driven by students expected to be top performers. The effect on test scores translates into significant changes in studentsâ€™ allocation to college: female enrolment in the most selective degrees declines, together with expected earnings.

                        University of Pretoria as the ABSA Chair of Data Science. He works on developing Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence methods to extract insights from data. A large part of his work over the last few years has
                        been in the intersection of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (due to the abundance of text data and need to extract insights). As part of his vision for the ABSA Data Science chair, he is interested
                        in Data Science for Social Impact, using local challenges as a springboard for research. In this area, he has worked on projects in science, energy, public safety and utilities. He is an organiser of the Deep
                        Learning Indaba, the largest Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence workshop on the African continent, aiming to strengthen African Machine Learning. He is passionate about developing young talent, supervising MSc

                        She is also a faculty associate at the BerkmanKlein Center for Internet and Society, a faculty fellow at the Center for Democracy and Technology, and a member of the Twitter Academic Research Advisory Board. Her
                        research is at the intersection of applied demography, computational social science, and social policy. The first line of research examines the ethical implications of algorithmic decision-making in human services,
                        child welfare in particular. The second line of research looks at the lived experience of marginalized communities as self-reported on social media. The through line between the two concerns the methods involved: she
                        identifies as a methodologist in social work spaces, in as far as her substantive focus is how computational methods can support using large, unstructured data to scale social work interventions. For that reason
                        Rodriguez founded the caretLAB, the first lab housed in a school of social work to her knowledge dedicated to computational research methods in the public interest. Her lab works with technologists across fields of
                        inquiry to leverage cutting edge, innovative technologies to develop, implement, and evaluate scaled interventions.
