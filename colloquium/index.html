</center>
We will discuss the following questions. What is democratic backsliding? What makes a democracy stable? Which processes potentially lead to instability of a democratic system? How can complexity science help us understand and mitigate democratic backsliding? The talk is based on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-0518-0">this paper</a> and <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1361-6404/aaeb4d">this paper</a>.

                        <a href="http://socialwork.buffalo.edu/faculty-research/full-time-faculty/maria-rodriguez.html" target="_blank">Dr. Rodriguez</a> is an Assistant Professor at the University at Buffalo's School of Social Work (SUNY).
                        She is also a faculty associate at the BerkmanKlein Center for Internet and Society, a faculty fellow at the Center for Democracy and Technology, and a member of the Twitter Academic Research Advisory Board. Her
                        research is at the intersection of applied demography, computational social science, and social policy. The first line of research examines the ethical implications of algorithmic decision-making in human services,
                        child welfare in particular. The second line of research looks at the lived experience of marginalized communities as self-reported on social media. The through line between the two concerns the methods involved: she
                        identifies as a methodologist in social work spaces, in as far as her substantive focus is how computational methods can support using large, unstructured data to scale social work interventions. For that reason
                        Rodriguez founded the caretLAB, the first lab housed in a school of social work to her knowledge dedicated to computational research methods in the public interest. Her lab works with technologists across fields of
                        inquiry to leverage cutting edge, innovative technologies to develop, implement, and evaluate scaled interventions.

</h3>
		</center>
		<p>A great number of academic and industry initiatives seek to mitigate what are increasingly understood as ethical concerns in the development, implementation, and evaluation of algorithms in social contexts. Often, when confronted with questions of ethics within these socio-technical systems, engineers ,data scientists, and others turn to the field of Philosophy for help in trying to decide the balance between the right thing to do and what we can do. In this talk, Dr. Rodriguez presents her arguments for why most strands of moral philosophy are ill equipped to help us deal with the realities of algorithmic bias. Her arguments use evidence gleaned from years of professional experience in human services, her study of moral philosophy, as well as arguments put forth by a school of Black Philosophers. The aim of the talk to is to introduce the audience to more contextual forms of philosophizing, ones grounded in the realities of marginalized existence.</p>

                        <a href="https://www.vima.co.za/" target="_blank">Vukosi Marivate</a> holds a PhD in Computer Science (Rutgers University, as Fulbright Science and Technology Fellow) and MSc & BSc in Electrical Engineering (Wits University). Dr Marivate is based at the University of Pretoria as the UP ABSA Chair of Data Science. He works on developing Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence methods to extract insights from data. A large part of his work over the last few years has been in the intersection of  Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP). This has led to research outputs focused on how we can better improve low resource language tools, especially for African Languages. This has included creating new software libraries, new research approaches for robust NLP and encouraging the development of datasets for African languages. As part of his vision for the ABSA Data Science chair, Vukosi is interested in Data Science for Social Impact (https://dsfsi.github.io/), using local challenges as a springboard for research. In this area, Vukosi has worked on projects in science, energy, public safety and utilities. Vukosi is cofounder of the Deep Learning Indaba, the largest Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence workshop on the African continent, aiming to strengthen African Machine Learning.

</h3>
		</center>
		As practising Data Science researchers and practitioners, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighed both the need for data driven decision making and the reality of what it really takes to get to that point. It is not only about throwing data + model at a problem. It is about understanding the environment that one is in and then strategising on what might best work for that environment. In this talk I look back at some of the work we have done within responding to different challenges within both Data Science and Natural Language Processing. I place at the center people and how they are the important piece in our practice.		<p></p>
