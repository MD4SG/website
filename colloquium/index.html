</center>
Colleges and universities are among those that have been most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Even with a potential end to the ongoing global restrictions in sight, the manner in which these institutions operate is likely to be permanently altered as a result of the significant impact of the virus. Most notably, a more traditional, siloed approach to research will play a key role in effectively meeting the needs of local communities. Additionally, the existing teaching-learning paradigm will need to be reimagined, keeping in mind the transformation of the educational landscape. This session will address key global trends in the education sector, as well as propose some ideas on how universities can adopt a more proactive approach to cope with these changes.

Tina&#39;s work has been applied to personalized search on the World-Wide Web, statistical indices of large-scale scientific simulation data, fraud detection, mobile ad targeting, cyber situational awareness, and ethics in machine learning. Her algorithms have been incorporated into systems used by the government and industry (e.g., IBM System G Graph Analytics) as well as open-source software (e.g., Stanford Network Analysis Project). In 2017, Tina served as the program co-chair for the ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (a.k.a. KDD, which is the premier conference on data mining) and as the program co-chair for the International Conference on Network Science (a.k.a. NetSci, which is the premier conference on network science). In 2020, she served as the program co-chair for the International Conference on Computational Social Science (a.k.a. IC2S2, which is the premier conference on computational social science). Tina received an Outstanding Mentor Award from the Office of Science at the US Department of Energy in 2010; and became a Fellow of the ISI Foundation in Turin Italy in 2019.</p>

<h2>Vukosi Marivate, University of Pretoria, South Africa</h2>

<hr class="projectTitle" />
<p><strong>Date:</strong> April, TBA</p>
&nbsp;

<p class="abstract"><a href="https://www.vima.co.za/" target="_blank">Vukosi Marivate</a> holds a PhD in Computer Science (Rutgers University) and MSc; BSc in Electrical Engineering (Wits University). He is currently based at the University of Pretoria as the ABSA Chair of Data Science. He works on developing Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence methods to extract insights from data. A large part of his work over the last few years has been in the intersection of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (due to the abundance of text data and need to extract insights). As part of his vision for the ABSA Data Science chair, he is interested in Data Science for Social Impact, using local challenges as a springboard for research. In this area, he has worked on projects in science, energy, public safety and utilities. He is an organiser of the Deep Learning Indaba, the largest Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence workshop on the African continent, aiming to strengthen African Machine Learning. He is passionate about developing young talent, supervising MSc and PhD students and mentoring budding Data Scientists.</p>

<h2>Maria Rodriguez, University at Buffalo</h2>

<hr class="projectTitle" />
<p><strong>Date:</strong> May, TTBA</p>
&nbsp;

<p class="abstract"><a href="http://socialwork.buffalo.edu/faculty-research/full-time-faculty/maria-rodriguez.html" target="_blank">Dr. Rodriguez</a> is an Assistant Professor at the University at Buffalo's School of Social Work (SUNY). She is also  a faculty associate at the BerkmanKlein Center for Internet and Society, a faculty fellow at the Center for Democracy and Technology, and a member of the Twitter Academic Research Advisory Board.  Her research is at the intersection of applied demography, computational social science, and social policy. The first line of research examines the ethical implications of algorithmic decision-making in human services, child welfare in particular. The second line of research looks at the lived experience of marginalized communities as self-reported on social media. The through line between the two concerns the methods involved: she identifies as a methodologist in social work spaces, in as far as her substantive focus is how computational methods can support using large, unstructured data  to scale social work interventions. For that reason Rodriguez founded the caretLAB, the first lab housed in a school of social work to her knowledge dedicated to computational research methods in the public interest. Her lab works with technologists across fields of inquiry to leverage cutting edge, innovative technologies to develop, implement, and evaluate scaled interventions.</p>
