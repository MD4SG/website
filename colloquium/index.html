				<a href="https://www.justfix.nyc/en/our-mission" target="_blank">JustFix</a>'s work building anti-eviction web apps early in the pandemic led us to change our philosophy on how tech can best serve tenants. We experienced the mismatch between legislative and software dev cycles (not the way you'd think!), the limits of organizing within the system, and the power of open data to put external pressure on bad landlords and brokers. We'll preview some of our new tool ideas that fit this "type three" paradigm of working outside existing systems to push for housing justice. In this talk, we will hear about Justfix's pro-tenant tools, what goes into deciding what tech to build from a political and strategic perspective and how we address the tools' potential for harm and mitigating and designing to avoid that harm in the setting of a non-profit organization. The discussion will be moderated by Daniel Waldinger in bridging social, economic, and policy perspectives on public housing allocation.

                        <p>
				The A.I. Industry has powered a futuristic reality of self-driving cars and voice assistants to help us with almost any need. However, the A.I. Industry has also created systematic challenges. For instance, while it has led to platforms where workers label data to improve machine learning algorithms,  my research has uncovered that these workers earn less than minimum wage. We are also seeing the surge of A.I. algorithms that privilege certain populations and racially exclude others. If we were able to fix these challenges we could create greater societal justice and enable A.I. that better addresses people’s needs, especially groups we have traditionally excluded. In this talk, I will discuss some of these urgent global problems that my research has uncovered from the A.I. Industry. I will present how we can start to address these problems through my proposed "A.I. For Good" framework. My framework uses value sensitive design to understand people's values and rectify harm. I will present case-studies where I use this framework to design A.I. systems that improve the labor conditions of the workers operating behind the scenes in our A.I. industry. I conclude by presenting a research agenda for studying the impact of A.I. in society; and researching effective socio-technical solutions in favor of workers.

                        </center>
                        <p>
                            Most of the big internet companies, such as Facebook, Google, or Twitter, generate their revenue from targeted advertising. To offer advertisers with advanced targeting capabilities, these companies collect large amounts of user data to build elaborate profiles. Based on these profiles an advertiser can then choose to target only, say, female Facebook users living in Norte de Santander who are aged 18-24, who used to live in Venezuela, and who have access to an iOS device. To help advertisers in planning their advertising campaigns and the related budget needs, the advertising platforms provide so-called audience estimates on how many of their users match the provided targeting criteria. In the example above, Facebook estimates that there are 1,800 matching monthly active users (as of Mid-December 2021). In this talk, I’ll describe how, in close collaboration with different UN agencies, we’re tapping into these audience estimates to (i) monitor international migration, (ii) track digital gender gaps, and (iii) map wealth inequalities. We consistently find that, despite fake profiles, and noise in the inference algorithms, data derived from the advertising platforms can provide valuable information that is complementary to other data sources. So data collected for the explicit purpose of selling advertisements and profit maximization can be repurposed for social good. At the same time, our work shows the risk of identifying vulnerable groups, rather than individuals, which is often not adequately considered in discussions focused on individual privacy. Furthermore, it raises questions on what the relationship between internet giants and statistical offices should be.

                            <a href="http://socialwork.buffalo.edu/faculty-research/full-time-faculty/maria-rodriguez.html" target="_blank">Dr. Rodriguez</a> is an Assistant Professor at the University at Buffalo's School of Social Work (SUNY). She is also a
                            faculty associate at the BerkmanKlein Center for Internet and Society, a faculty fellow at the Center for Democracy and Technology, and a member of the Twitter Academic Research Advisory Board. Her research is at the intersection of
                            applied demography, computational social science, and social policy. The first line of research examines the ethical implications of algorithmic decision-making in human services, child welfare in particular. The second line of
                            research looks at the lived experience of marginalized communities as self-reported on social media. The through line between the two concerns the methods involved: she identifies as a methodologist in social work spaces, in as far
                            as her substantive focus is how computational methods can support using large, unstructured data to scale social work interventions. For that reason Rodriguez founded the caretLAB, the first lab housed in a school of social work to

                        </center>
                        <p>
                            A great number of academic and industry initiatives seek to mitigate what are increasingly understood as ethical concerns in the development, implementation, and evaluation of algorithms in social contexts. Often, when confronted
                            with questions of ethics within these socio-technical systems, engineers ,data scientists, and others turn to the field of Philosophy for help in trying to decide the balance between the right thing to do and what we can do. In this
                            talk, Dr. Rodriguez presents her arguments for why most strands of moral philosophy are ill equipped to help us deal with the realities of algorithmic bias. Her arguments use evidence gleaned from years of professional experience in
                            human services, her study of moral philosophy, as well as arguments put forth by a school of Black Philosophers. The aim of the talk is to introduce the audience to more contextual forms of philosophizing, ones grounded in the
                            realities of marginalized existence.

                        As practising Data Science researchers and practitioners, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighed both the need for data driven decision making and the reality of what it really takes to get to that point. It is not only about throwing data + model at a problem. It is about understanding the environment that one is in and then strategising on what might best work for that environment. In this talk I look back at some of the work we have done within responding to different challenges within both Data Science and Natural Language Processing. I place at the center people and how they are the important piece in our practice.		<p></p>

                    </h3>
                    </center>
                    We study the effects of a reform that increased the stakes of the national exam at the end of high school for university enrolment in Spain. We find a negative effect of the reform on female test scores, driven by a worse performance in the exams for which the stakes increase the most, and driven by students expected to be top performers. The effect on test scores translates into significant changes in students’ allocation to college: female enrolment in the most selective degrees declines, together with expected earnings.

                    </center>
                    Colleges and universities are among those that have been most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Even with a potential end to the ongoing global restrictions in sight, the manner in which these institutions operate is likely to be permanently altered as a result of the significant impact of the virus. Most notably, a more traditional, siloed approach to research will play a key role in effectively meeting the needs of local communities. Additionally, the existing teaching-learning paradigm will need to be reimagined, keeping in mind the transformation of the educational landscape. This session will address key global trends in the education sector, as well as propose some ideas on how universities can adopt a more proactive approach to cope with these changes.

                        The Census is doing something new and interesting this year: implementing a differentially private algorithm called TopDown, so named because it works its way down the levels of a geographic hierarchy. The Census is already facing lots
                        of scrutiny of its ability to provide a reliable count for marginalized communities under unprecedented political pressure from the White House and in pandemic conditions. Will this privacy protection mechanism result in erasure and
                        undercounting for the same hard-to-count groups? What are the impacts on redistricting and the enforcement of the Voting Rights Act? I'll describe joint work with Aloni Cohen, JN Matthews, Bhushan Suwal, and Peter Wayner, incorporating
                        reconstruction data from Mark Hansen and Denis Kazakov. No prior knowledge of U.S. politics required!

                        </center>
                        This will be a (mostly) non-technical talk describing my experience working on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06326">this project</a>. The paper is motivated by healthcare exchanges, where a designer can&#39;t directly set prices,
                        but can regulate which providers enter the market. The two extremes to have in mind are typical employer exchanges in the US (which typically limit entry to few providers) or government exchanges (which typically do not). The paper
                        provides a mathematical model to reason about tradeoffs between these two paradigms. I will describe the model and results from this paper, but mostly focus on my experience learning about healthcare through the MD4SG working group,
                        from the perspective of someone with a CS theory background. The referenced work is joint with <a href="https://messaidi.github.io/">Meryem Essaidi</a> (Princeton) and <a href="https://www.kiragoldner.com/">Kira Goldner</a> (Columbia).

                        </center>
                        Operations research methods have been used to identify and evaluate solutions to the reconfiguration of public school attendance area boundaries for over fifty years. The talk will explore connections between evolving issues in public
                        education and advances in optimization, computing and geographic information systems, beginning with early work motivated by Supreme Court decisions to desegregate schools. We will also discuss how the limitations of early models and
                        solution approaches hindered their applicability. The years since have seen new research directions to address additional challenges related to the design of school attendance boundaries and leverage emerging advances in technology. The
                        talk will end with a reflection on current issues facing public school districts, including school busing and return-to-school plans amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and the ways in which operations research can be part of these discussions.

                    </h3>
                    </center>

                    Direct payments from the $2.2 trillion CARES Act passed by Congress should get 
                    to roughly 80% of Americans - tax filers and those receiving federal assistance - relatively quickly, 
                    about three weeks. The other 20% represent some of the most vulnerable people 
                    in the economy - the "underbanked" (19% of Americans), those who don't make 
                    enough income to file tax returns (or don't file for other reasons), and those 
                    for whom addresses have changed or are not readily available. Many are low-wage 
                    workers among the record 30 million who filed for unemployment insurance in the 
                    last four weeks. This pandemic and resulting human, economic, and financial 
                    crises are unfolding at break-neck speed, and bills were and are still due. 
                    These payments of $1,200 per adult will be a critical first lifeline for many 
                    households and the economy. To minimize the likelihood that an illiquidity crisis 
                    becomes a bankruptcy crisis in the coming weeks and months, Congress and the 
                    Treasury (with the Federal Reserve and FDIC) must act with all deliberate speed 
                    to get people paid now and not months from now. Ninety-six percent of American 
                    adults have cell phones or smartphones that could be used to speed up payments 
                    to those who are not on IRS or federal assistance rolls. A substantial share of 
                    smartphone users already makes payments using mobile platforms. Both the literature 
                    and recent experience of financial institutions suggest that the mobile money 
                    infrastructure that already can be leveraged to great effect in this crisis, 
                    and, more generally, the digital infrastructure of the federal government must 
                    be upgraded before the next crisis.

                    </center>

                    Advances in information and communication technologies (ICTs) have energized 
                    governments, global agencies and non-profit organizations to seek applications 
                    of these technologies to social and economic development. Researchers and other 
                    scholars have followed suit with a slew of research and intervention projects to 
                    explore, understand or measure the potential and actual impacts of ICTs. 
                    The results so far are, at best, mixed. I will share observations from several 
                    years of organizing research on ICTs and development around the world. Research 
                    findings and fieldwork experiences provide insights on what not to expect from 
                    ICTD research and interventions.

                    </h3>
                    </center>

                    Global markets have been vital engines of economic growth.  They have also driven 
                    massive depletion of natural resources, such as forests and fisheries, and the 
                    escalation of greenhouse gas emissions.  In recent years, we've seen NGOs 
                    multinational companies, and sometimes international organizations and governments, 
                    work together to harness global markets to spur a transition to sustainability.  
                    In this session we'll explore efforts to address deforestation and overfishing. 
                    We'll look at how these collaborations have been able to drive change and consider
                    some of the challenges they face in translating commitments into action and taking action to scale.

                    </center>

                    Recent events have made evident the fact that algorithms can
                    be discriminatory, reinforce human prejudices, accelerate the spread
                    of misinformation, and are generally not as objective as they are
                    widely thought to be. In this talk, I will present a vignette from my
                    recent work which tackles the problem of discrimination in housing and
                    employment via online ad platforms. Recent studies show that the
                    audience an ad gets shown to can be discriminatory with respect to
                    socially salient attributes such as gender and race, crossing ethical
                    and legal boundaries. To mitigate this, we propose a constrained
                    optimization framework that allows the platform to control the
                    audience that an online ad auction gives to an advertiser in a manner
                    that avoids discriminatory allocation. Finding the parameters of this
                    optimal auction, however, turns out to be a non-convex problem. We
                    show how we can leverage the structure of the problem to develop a
                    fast algorithm to solve it, resulting in a new auction mechanism that
                    has the potential to alleviate bias in online advertising while
                    simultaneously maintaining good empirical performance with respect to
                    revenue. We will further discuss the hurdles in implementing such an
                    approach, yet the importance of doing so.

                    </center>

                    Concerns about online manipulation have centered on fears about undermining the autonomy of consumers and citizens. Less analyzed are the risks that the same techniques of personalizing information online can also threaten equality. When predictive algorithms are used to allocate information about opportunities like employment, housing and credit, they can reproduce past patterns of discrimination and exclusion in these markets. In this talk, I will focus on the labor market and the increasingly dominant role of tech intermediaries in managing interactions between job-seekers and firms. Because these intermediaries rely on past behavioral data to distribute information about job openings and match job-seekers with hiring firms, their predictions about who will be a good match for which jobs will likely reflect existing occupational segregation and inequality. I will discuss the legal and policy implications of tech intermediaries' new role in labor markets, including the challenges in holding them responsible for discriminatory effects and the possibility of other regulatory responses that might address these concerns.

                    </center>

                    Since the turn of the millennium, the interdisciplinary field of information & communication technologies and development (ICTD) has explored how digital technologies could contribute to international socio-economic development. The associated research community includes both techno-utopians who imagine that just about any problem can be solved with the right application of technology, as well as extreme skeptics wary of any attempts at intervention. Debates continue, but in this talk, I will attempt to summarize some of the expressed consensus in ICTD -- things that not everyone necessarily believes, but will at least pay lip service to. I will also discuss what I call technology's "Law of Amplification," which reconciles some of the differing opinions in ICTD and also offers guidance for how mechanism design can have real-world impact.

                    </center>

                    There is growing demand for a genuinely accountable government which, even with limited resources, delivers programs and policies with meaningful, measurable impact. Rapid advances in technology support the use of data and science in the private sector to develop insights about what people need, innovate products and policies to meet those needs, and then measure their success. Government has the potential to be similarly impactful, prompting recent federal and state calls for government to use a data-driven approach to produce efficient and effective policy solutions. But how can state and local governments use data and science to deliver improved results to their constituents? This talk will highlight the key challenges to creating and supporting fact-based policy at the state and local level, and will outline solutions and lessons learned from an innovative and scalable partnership model developed with the state of Rhode Island.

                    </center>

                    Police officers in the United States currently kill about eleven hundred civilians annually. In contrast, police in Germany kill fewer than ten a year, and those in England and Wales kill about two. This talk will examine recent data on police homicides in the US, with particular attention to the geographic distribution of incidents and racial disparities in victimization. I consider and evaluate two competing hypotheses that seek to account for the data, and discuss the possibility that Simpson's paradox may be relevant for understanding the patterns that we see. Some historical context is provided with reference to the 1968 Kerner Commission Report and the Carnegie-Myrdal study of the 1930s.

                    The talk will draw on material from Shadows of Doubt: Stereotypes, Crime and the Pursuit of Justice, written jointly with Brendan O'Flaherty (Harvard University Press, forthcoming in April 2019) as well as ongoing work with Jose Luis Monteil Olea and Brendan O'Flaherty.

                    </center>
                    Can we identify highly central individuals in a network without collecting network data, simply by asking community members? Can seeding information via such nominated individuals lead to significantly wider diffusion than {choosing} randomly chosen people, or even respected ones? In two separate large field experiments in India, we answer both questions in the affirmative. In particular, in 521 villages in Haryana, we provided information on monthly immunization camps to either randomly selected individuals (in some villages) or to individuals nominated by villagers as people who would be good at transmitting information (in other villages). We find that the number of children vaccinated every month is 22% higher in villages in which nominees received the information. We show that people's knowledge of who are highly central individuals and good seeds can be explained by a model in which community members simply track how often they hear gossip about others. Indeed, we find in a third dataset that nominated seeds are central in a network sense, {and are} not just those with many friends or in {powerful} positions.

                    </center>
                    Today's Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are designed to address one of society's most pressing problems---unemployment. These technologies support job seekers' ability to search for jobs, create resumes, highlight skills, share employment opportunities, and even transport to work and job counseling. However, the benefits of employment tools and technologies are unequally distributed and provide limited advantages for certain populations in our society. Like other valuable resources, ICTs have done little to support individuals with limited knowledge, skills, or experience to leverage them and who often face geographic and social isolation. Without an understanding of how people from low-resource settings use ICTs for job seeking, the same employment inequalities that occur offline will be repeated in online contexts. 

                    In this presentation, I will discuss the results of several studies that investigate how ICTs could improve employability, particularly among job seekers with limited digital skills, education, and income, and those who are geographically and socially isolated. I will also discuss new principles for fostering innovations among these populations and identify barriers for designers and technologists to address in the future.

                        people who do not intend to participate in the market may nevertheless be important for market design. This talk will illustrate these points with some examples, drawing on experience from the design of school choice systems and kidney
                        exchange clearinghouses.

                        </center>
                        Feeding America distributes food to food banks across the United States. In 2005, it transitioned from a centralized allocation process to one where local affiliates would bid for food items through an online auction mechanism. To do
                        so, it constructed a specialized currency called &ldquo;shares&rdquo;. The change, its necessary idiosyncrasies, and outcomes are described here. We both show that the new system exhibits desirable theoretical properties, and document
                        considerable welfare implications. The choices of the food banks vary enormously from the allocations they received under the old system, and much of this gain is from sorting of food banks along the quality-quantity dimension.
                        Furthermore, supply of food rose by roughly 100 million pounds around the time of its introduction. A structural exercise estimates that the value of reallocated demand effectively meant that each pound of food allocated through this
                        system increased efficiency by almost another additional pound.
