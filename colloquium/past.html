</center>
The Census is doing something new and interesting this year:  implementing a differentially private algorithm called TopDown, so named because it works its way down the levels of a geographic hierarchy.  The Census is already facing lots of scrutiny of its ability to provide a reliable count for marginalized communities under unprecedented political pressure from the White House and in pandemic conditions.  Will this privacy protection mechanism result in erasure and undercounting for the same hard-to-count groups?  What are the impacts on redistricting and the enforcement of the Voting Rights Act?  I'll describe joint work with Aloni Cohen, JN Matthews, Bhushan Suwal, and Peter Wayner, incorporating reconstruction data from Mark Hansen and Denis Kazakov.  No prior knowledge of U.S. politics required!

</center>
This will be a (mostly) non-technical talk describing my experience working on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06326">this project</a>. The paper is motivated by healthcare exchanges, where a designer can&#39;t directly set prices, but can regulate which providers enter the market. The two extremes to have in mind are typical employer exchanges in the US (which typically limit entry to few providers) or government exchanges (which typically do not). The paper provides a mathematical model to reason about tradeoffs between these two paradigms. I will describe the model and results from this paper, but mostly focus on my experience learning about healthcare through the MD4SG working group, from the perspective of someone with a CS theory background. The referenced work is joint with <a href="https://messaidi.github.io/">Meryem Essaidi</a> (Princeton) and <a href="https://www.kiragoldner.com/">Kira Goldner</a> (Columbia).

</center>
Operations research methods have been used to identify and evaluate solutions to the reconfiguration of public school attendance area boundaries for over fifty years. The talk will explore connections between evolving issues in public education and advances in optimization, computing and geographic information systems, beginning with early work motivated by Supreme Court decisions to desegregate schools. We will also discuss how the limitations of early models and solution approaches hindered their applicability. The years since have seen new research directions to address additional challenges related to the design of school attendance boundaries and leverage emerging advances in technology. The talk will end with a reflection on current issues facing public school districts, including school busing and return-to-school plans amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and the ways in which operations research can be part of these discussions.

</h3>
</center>

Direct payments from the $2.2 trillion CARES Act passed by Congress should get 
to roughly 80% of Americans - tax filers and those receiving federal assistance - relatively quickly, 
about three weeks. The other 20% represent some of the most vulnerable people 
in the economy - the "underbanked" (19% of Americans), those who don't make 
enough income to file tax returns (or don't file for other reasons), and those 
for whom addresses have changed or are not readily available. Many are low-wage 
workers among the record 30 million who filed for unemployment insurance in the 
last four weeks. This pandemic and resulting human, economic, and financial 
crises are unfolding at break-neck speed, and bills were and are still due. 
These payments of $1,200 per adult will be a critical first lifeline for many 
households and the economy. To minimize the likelihood that an illiquidity crisis 
becomes a bankruptcy crisis in the coming weeks and months, Congress and the 
Treasury (with the Federal Reserve and FDIC) must act with all deliberate speed 
to get people paid now and not months from now. Ninety-six percent of American 
adults have cell phones or smartphones that could be used to speed up payments 
to those who are not on IRS or federal assistance rolls. A substantial share of 
smartphone users already makes payments using mobile platforms. Both the literature 
and recent experience of financial institutions suggest that the mobile money 
infrastructure that already can be leveraged to great effect in this crisis, 
and, more generally, the digital infrastructure of the federal government must 
be upgraded before the next crisis.

Advances in information and communication technologies (ICTs) have energized 
governments, global agencies and non-profit organizations to seek applications 
of these technologies to social and economic development. Researchers and other 
scholars have followed suit with a slew of research and intervention projects to 
explore, understand or measure the potential and actual impacts of ICTs. 
The results so far are, at best, mixed. I will share observations from several 
years of organizing research on ICTs and development around the world. Research 
findings and fieldwork experiences provide insights on what not to expect from 
ICTD research and interventions.

</h3>
</center>

Global markets have been vital engines of economic growth.  They have also driven 
massive depletion of natural resources, such as forests and fisheries, and the 
escalation of greenhouse gas emissions.  In recent years, we've seen NGOs 
multinational companies, and sometimes international organizations and governments, 
work together to harness global markets to spur a transition to sustainability.  
In this session we'll explore efforts to address deforestation and overfishing. 
We'll look at how these collaborations have been able to drive change and consider
some of the challenges they face in translating commitments into action and taking action to scale.

</center>

Recent events have made evident the fact that algorithms can
be discriminatory, reinforce human prejudices, accelerate the spread
of misinformation, and are generally not as objective as they are
widely thought to be. In this talk, I will present a vignette from my
recent work which tackles the problem of discrimination in housing and
employment via online ad platforms. Recent studies show that the
audience an ad gets shown to can be discriminatory with respect to
socially salient attributes such as gender and race, crossing ethical
and legal boundaries. To mitigate this, we propose a constrained
optimization framework that allows the platform to control the
audience that an online ad auction gives to an advertiser in a manner
that avoids discriminatory allocation. Finding the parameters of this
optimal auction, however, turns out to be a non-convex problem. We
show how we can leverage the structure of the problem to develop a
fast algorithm to solve it, resulting in a new auction mechanism that
has the potential to alleviate bias in online advertising while
simultaneously maintaining good empirical performance with respect to
revenue. We will further discuss the hurdles in implementing such an
approach, yet the importance of doing so.

    font-weight: bold;"> Manipulating Opportunity: Online Market Intermediaries and Risks of Discrimination</h3>
</center>

Concerns about online manipulation have centered on fears about undermining the autonomy of consumers and citizens. Less analyzed are the risks that the same techniques of personalizing information online can also threaten equality. When predictive algorithms are used to allocate information about opportunities like employment, housing and credit, they can reproduce past patterns of discrimination and exclusion in these markets. In this talk, I will focus on the labor market and the increasingly dominant role of tech intermediaries in managing interactions between job-seekers and firms. Because these intermediaries rely on past behavioral data to distribute information about job openings and match job-seekers with hiring firms, their predictions about who will be a good match for which jobs will likely reflect existing occupational segregation and inequality. I will discuss the legal and policy implications of tech intermediaries' new role in labor markets, including the challenges in holding them responsible for discriminatory effects and the possibility of other regulatory responses that might address these concerns.

</center>

Since the turn of the millennium, the interdisciplinary field of information & communication technologies and development (ICTD) has explored how digital technologies could contribute to international socio-economic development. The associated research community includes both techno-utopians who imagine that just about any problem can be solved with the right application of technology, as well as extreme skeptics wary of any attempts at intervention. Debates continue, but in this talk, I will attempt to summarize some of the expressed consensus in ICTD -- things that not everyone necessarily believes, but will at least pay lip service to. I will also discuss what I call technology's "Law of Amplification," which reconciles some of the differing opinions in ICTD and also offers guidance for how mechanism design can have real-world impact.

</center>

There is growing demand for a genuinely accountable government which, even with limited resources, delivers programs and policies with meaningful, measurable impact. Rapid advances in technology support the use of data and science in the private sector to develop insights about what people need, innovate products and policies to meet those needs, and then measure their success. Government has the potential to be similarly impactful, prompting recent federal and state calls for government to use a data-driven approach to produce efficient and effective policy solutions. But how can state and local governments use data and science to deliver improved results to their constituents? This talk will highlight the key challenges to creating and supporting fact-based policy at the state and local level, and will outline solutions and lessons learned from an innovative and scalable partnership model developed with the state of Rhode Island.

</center>

Police officers in the United States currently kill about eleven hundred civilians annually. In contrast, police in Germany kill fewer than ten a year, and those in England and Wales kill about two. This talk will examine recent data on police homicides in the US, with particular attention to the geographic distribution of incidents and racial disparities in victimization. I consider and evaluate two competing hypotheses that seek to account for the data, and discuss the possibility that Simpson's paradox may be relevant for understanding the patterns that we see. Some historical context is provided with reference to the 1968 Kerner Commission Report and the Carnegie-Myrdal study of the 1930s.

The talk will draw on material from Shadows of Doubt: Stereotypes, Crime and the Pursuit of Justice, written jointly with Brendan O'Flaherty (Harvard University Press, forthcoming in April 2019) as well as ongoing work with Jose Luis Monteil Olea and Brendan O'Flaherty.

</center>
Can we identify highly central individuals in a network without collecting network data, simply by asking community members? Can seeding information via such nominated individuals lead to significantly wider diffusion than {choosing} randomly chosen people, or even respected ones? In two separate large field experiments in India, we answer both questions in the affirmative. In particular, in 521 villages in Haryana, we provided information on monthly immunization camps to either randomly selected individuals (in some villages) or to individuals nominated by villagers as people who would be good at transmitting information (in other villages). We find that the number of children vaccinated every month is 22% higher in villages in which nominees received the information. We show that people's knowledge of who are highly central individuals and good seeds can be explained by a model in which community members simply track how often they hear gossip about others. Indeed, we find in a third dataset that nominated seeds are central in a network sense, {and are} not just those with many friends or in {powerful} positions.

    font-weight: bold;">Designing and Envisioning Digital Tools for Low-resource Job Seekers</h3>
</center>
Today's Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are designed to address one of society's most pressing problems---unemployment. These technologies support job seekers' ability to search for jobs, create resumes, highlight skills, share employment opportunities, and even transport to work and job counseling. However, the benefits of employment tools and technologies are unequally distributed and provide limited advantages for certain populations in our society. Like other valuable resources, ICTs have done little to support individuals with limited knowledge, skills, or experience to leverage them and who often face geographic and social isolation. Without an understanding of how people from low-resource settings use ICTs for job seeking, the same employment inequalities that occur offline will be repeated in online contexts. 

In this presentation, I will discuss the results of several studies that investigate how ICTs could improve employability, particularly among job seekers with limited digital skills, education, and income, and those who are geographically and socially isolated. I will also discuss new principles for fostering innovations among these populations and identify barriers for designers and technologists to address in the future.

</center>
Marketplaces are often small parts of large markets, and so potential marketplace participants may have large strategy sets, that include actions taken outside of the marketplace. And markets require social support, so the behavior of people who do not intend to participate in the market may nevertheless be important for market design. This talk will illustrate these points with some examples, drawing on experience from the design of school choice systems and kidney exchange clearinghouses.

    font-weight: bold;">The Allocation of Food to Food Banks</h3>
</center>
Feeding America distributes food to food banks across the United States. In 2005, it transitioned from a centralized allocation process to one where local affiliates would bid for food items through an online auction mechanism. To do so, it constructed a specialized currency called &ldquo;shares&rdquo;. The change, its necessary idiosyncrasies, and outcomes are described here. We both show that the new system exhibits desirable theoretical properties, and document considerable welfare implications. The choices of the food banks vary enormously from the allocations they received under the old system, and much of this gain is from sorting of food banks along the quality-quantity dimension. Furthermore, supply of food rose by roughly 100 million pounds around the time of its introduction. A structural exercise estimates that the value of reallocated demand effectively meant that each pound of food allocated through this system increased efficiency by almost another additional pound.
